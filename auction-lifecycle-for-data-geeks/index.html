<div class="entry-content"><p>I collected stats from my first sell-side eBay transaction: number of watchers, number of bids, and current item price. Here&rsquo;s what I found:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.yort.com/blog/auction-lifecycle-1.png" alt="Auction Watchers, Bids, and Price Over Time" /></p>

<p>Specifics: eBay, 7 day duration, start $0.01, no reserve, $167.50 sale, digital camera, July 2009</p>

<h3>30-second Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>30-50% of prospects are trolling for a bargain that probably doesn&rsquo;t exist</p></li>
<li><p>May be an untapped strategy in bidding at 70% of sale price to &ldquo;stake a claim&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Last-minute emotions didn&rsquo;t affect the price much</p></li>
<li><p>7 days may not be long enough for all prospects to discover</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>What&rsquo;s noteworthy?</h3>

<h4>Ratio of watchers:bids (casual interest:purchase intent)</h4>

<p>For most buyers, this auction was a 2-stage process: find &amp; watch, wait a couple days, then monitor &amp; bid. Visible interest accumulates for 2.5 days, peaking at 11 watchers per 1 bid, then steadily drops to 1.5:1 at sale.</p>

<p>As the end approaches, there are far fewer lookie-loos relative to participants - most have either bid or left (un-watched) - and the ratio sinks. Nobody bids upfront, probably from past experience: each person knows nobody else will bid, so they just watch too.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.yort.com/blog/auction-lifecycle-2.png" alt="Ratio of Auction Watchers, Bids, and Price" /></p>

<h4>Ratio of price:bids (strength &amp; frequency of purchase intent)</h4>

<p>Because bidding is idle in days 2 and 3, this ratio starts and stays high ($17 of item price per 1 bid). Then bids trend smaller for 2 days, dropping to an average of $7 per bid. Just like a regular auction, the price increase per new bid is smaller later in the auction, though the absolute price increase is large thanks to lots of bids.</p>

<p>Only in the last hour does the dollars per bid spike again, and only in relative terms - small change that happens very quickly. That&rsquo;s the sniper, who must overshoot because there&rsquo;s only one chance to snipe. A larger spike here would indicate a desperate sniper.</p>

<h4>Ratio of price:watchers (strength &amp; frequency of casual interest)</h4>

<p>This stays pretty constant throughout the auction until it rises in the last 2 days  I interpret that as bargain hunters bailing (un-watching) while bidding heats up.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>Watchers is linear for the first part of the auction, then bargain hunters start to realize they&rsquo;re not going to get a steal. They adapt: they un-watch the item before it ends.  Watchers started dropping about 12 hours before the auction ended, when the price was at about 60% of final sale price.  This shows that some buyers still think it&rsquo;s a good use of time to hunt for undervalued items. That&rsquo;s a challenge with sub-$200 commodity gadgets.</p>

<p>Assuming our sample size of 1 was representative, one could fit a line to the price ramp and estimate the ending price of a halfway complete auction. This actually might not be far off, at least for auctions matching the same specifics (duration, reserve, category, etc.)</p>

<p>3 bids arrived in the last 40 seconds, yet those were the only bids in the last few hours. I checked the history of automatic bids (where eBay rebids up to your max allowed amount) vs. user-entered ones: only 2 people (winner and 1 other bidder) were online at 11 AM when the auction ended. Only one of them bid until the last 10 seconds. Unlike live auctions, last-minute emotions didn&rsquo;t affect the price much.</p>

<p>This reinforces that online auctions aren&rsquo;t impulse-driven, at least for smaller items that can&rsquo;t draw enough live users to start a bidding war. Someone may get caught up in their own re-bidding midway through the auction, and there&rsquo;s an adrenaline rush for those few who actively bid when it ends, but in this auction there wasn&rsquo;t any going-once gavel pounding.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Although the winner asked me a question 2-3 days in, their first and only bid was 7 seconds before the end. This was destined to be sniped from the very start.</p>

<p>No one jumps in and makes a semi-serious bid (say, over 60% of final price) before they need to. The serious prospects believe that by placing a real bid, they&rsquo;ll increase the baseline and consequently the sale price. In a sense, we&rsquo;re telling ourselves that we might get a steal by not bidding, and that other people&rsquo;s bid increases are based on the current price more than their willingness to pay.</p>

<p>That may be true when many buyers are already watching an item. However, I could see making a bid on day 1 that&rsquo;s 70% of final value, and thereby decreasing the number of people who bother to watch it. Basically, you&rsquo;d claim the item for yourself, like bluffing in poker. Assuming the higher first bid translated into fewer watchers, I could see that keeping the final price lower.</p>

<p>Prospective bidders may have still been discovering the item 7 days in. The number of watchers never really flatlined. While the total number of watchers dropped at the very end, we can&rsquo;t tell whether those folks un-watching were partially offset by new watchers. Based on how quickly the watchers dropped in the final 12 hours, I&rsquo;m guessing the short flat-lining was driven by the auction ending.</p>

<p>Would more people watch an 8 or 9 day auction?  Probably.  Whether one of those watchers would be willing to pay more is a much harder question.</p>

<h3>Ideas</h3>

<p>Because eBay doesn&rsquo;t provide an in-depth event history, we don&rsquo;t know when the 2 ending bidders watched the item, nor how they found it (search? what keywords? browse? which category?). A deep &ldquo;event log&rdquo; with timestamps, referral reason, and username could let sellers write custom auction strategy management tools - innovate on selling strategy rather than logistics or sourcing.</p>

<p>I could see charging for that post-transaction visibility, since pro sellers are the only ones likely to refine listing strategy, and presumably they&rsquo;re receiving higher sale prices. Bigger challenge: Prospective buyers would need to acknowledge a warning that their watch interest would be made available to the seller, whether or not they actually bid.</p>

<p>About 1 in 3 watchers explicitly un-watched this item in the few days after it ended, rather than letting eBay roll it off their watch list. This may mean that eBay can to do a better job of post-auction cleanup or item segmentation, or that 1 in 3 people are really pedantic.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still room for an auction format which ends 10 minutes after the final bid. Such a hybrid of &ldquo;buy it now&rdquo; and traditional auctions that might actually speed the auction up - nobody will be motivated by end time, and that could front-load the bidding. Wouldn&rsquo;t take much to be more front-loaded than this auction was.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Bid amount is public-facing current bid, and includes automatic bid. By default, eBay post-auction bid history does not include automatic bids.</p>
