This is the mobile carrier customer dashboard that I want (or see as a [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yortlabs/sets/72157627583858838/)). The annotations tell the story.

I'm hoping that at least one of Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&T will eventually realize that transparency is a differentiator (if only because they run out of other ways to stand out). Most of these dashboard elements are possible with existing data that carriers already collect, and in some cases already have in this form for internal use.

This shows two variations on the same dashboard landing page.&nbsp;Click for larger versions to read the annotations.
