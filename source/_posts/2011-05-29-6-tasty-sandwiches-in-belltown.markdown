Here's a few well-executed sandwiches in or near our 'hood. Using the most liberal possible definition of "sandwich" and in no particular order:

1. El Cubano, [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/menu/menu.html).

    Sweet meets savory: "Roasted pulled pork, sliced pit ham, Jarlsberg cheese, thin sliced pickle, dijon mustard and poblano aioli on a grilled ciabatta." Early-afternoon weekend brunch material here.

2. East Coast or Chicken Chipotle, [Mike's East Coast Sandwiches](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mikes-east-coast-sandwiches-seattle)

    Update: Moved to Pioneer Square.

    Fresh off the panini grill at Cafe Two at Antioch College (with Stumptown drip coffee), Forza Coffee at Fisher Plaza, and Motore Coffee (9th & Lenora).

3. New Town Special, [New Town Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-town-market-seattle)

    I recommend smoked turkey instead of peppermill turkey. The same Boar's Head menu is available at [Westlake Specialty Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/westlake-specialty-market-seattle) (7th & Westlake).

4. Your custom deli sandwich, ordered online, [Specialty's Cafe](http://www.specialtys.com/Begin.aspx)

    Use their sandwich configurator to build a custom sandwich, then order and pay online for pick up in 15 minutes (yes, this actually works!). It's like they timed a leisurely walk from Belltown to 5th and Union. My pick: the [Taguchi Goat Club](https://twitter.com/#!/troyd/status/70897277027360768)

5. Spicy Moroccan Pita, [Zeitoon Cafe](http://www.zeitooncafe.com/Entree.pdf)

    Update: closed.

    "Dolme, hummus, tabouli, lettuce, cucumber, garlic sauce, house sauce, hot sauce and tzatziky." Pro tip: ask for light or no house sauce, and cut it in half before eating or you'll wear some leftovers home.</p>

6. The Gaucho Dip or 410 Burger, [El Gaucho Bar](http://www.elgaucho.com/elgaucho/images/menus_seattle/bar.pdf)

    The menu does its job: "Sliced Certified angus Beef prime top sirloin, toasted baguette, chimichurri aioli, english Coastal Cheddar, house au jus, taro chips." For 50% off, pair with a glass of wine and a friend (or an iPad) during "The Gaucho 120" (minutes of happy hour).

Enjoy!
