My take on productivity, [Taco](http://tacoapp.com/), is now on Kickstarter: [Taco: Basecamp to Zendesk, all your tasks in one place](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tacoapp/taco-basecamp-to-zendesk-all-your-tasks-in-one-pla). As I told friends:

Last week that secret weapon took on a life of its own when Taco launched [on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tacoapp/taco-basecamp-to-zendesk-all-your-tasks-in-one-pla).

Even the creator of Rails took notice:

Take a look and see whether it fits the way you work. I look forward to bringing you the same fine productivity I've enjoyed for 2 years.
