I posted a bit about my first 6 weeks with a standing desk on [Philip
Greenspun's blog](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2015/01/03/standing-and-treadmill-desk-ideas-and-experience/comment-page-1/#comment-260561). The post is below.

I bought both a [GeekDesk Max](http://www.geekdesk.com/geekdesk-max-frame-only) frame and an [Uplift 920](http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-920-electric-sit-stand-no-crossbar-desk-base-black.html). The 920 has a removable section of the desk mount so it can accept a full-depth keyboard drawer.

I kept the Uplift and after 2 months, am thrilled with it. They're both excellent products and incredible values. I opted for the Uplift because of the removable section, a longer warranty, no back brace between the legs (leaves room for bike or taller treadmill), and a design which allows the controls to be mounted anywhere. I don't see any difference in sturdiness or daily use. The motor on the Uplift is slightly faster, but it makes no difference. I mounted an IKEA Numerar solid butcher block on it, mostly because just about all desktops on the market are deeper than the ~24" I wanted.

A lot of adjustable standing desks are actually rebranded legs, controls, and control boxes from a company called LINAK: [LINAK](http://www.linak.com/products/lifting-columns.aspx?sbaid=2). Other than the very high-end office furniture makers, I'd guess more than half of electric adjustable desks are from LINAK VARs (GeekDesk and THS included): [LINAK Deskline](http://www.linak.com/deskline/)

Now that I know how to spot them, I see Uplifts everywhere. The standing desk photo in [this article](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/olafur-eliasson-interview-fondation-louis-vuitton/) is the Uplift or identical components.

Along with the desk, buy a large CumulusPRO mat: [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk-mat/). A quality anti-fatigue mat is not optional. I also use a Kinesis [Freestyle](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-mac/) split keyboard and Evoluent [VerticalMouse](http://evoluent.com/). Typing and mousing feel like extending my arms forward. Otherwise, just listen to your body. If you're exhausted or something hurts, sit down.

I have no firsthand experience with a treadmill desk. Our accountant uses a treadmill desk and has for years. He [swears by](https://twitter.com/papertrailapp/status/452162788547239936) it.

I bought my desk intending to add either a treadmill or a bike. Last week, I ordered a bike because I wanted to also use it for full-energy cycling (while not working or barely occupied). It's essentially [this](http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-spin-bike.html), only with a belt drive Sunny SF-B1002 flywheel bike instead of the chain drive Marcy bike in the photo.
