I've been asked for unique venues around Seattle for conferences, hack fests, user group meetings, and the like. Here's venues and types to check out.

### Startup standards & smaller

* [Capitol Hill Arts Center](http://www.capitolhillarts.com/) (CHAC)
* [Columbia City Theater](http://www.columbiacitytheater.com/)
* Coffee shops, especially large ones ([Zeitgeist](http://zeitgeistcoffee.com/), [Top Pot](http://www.toppotdoughnuts.com/)) and those that close early
* Pubs (less than 75, some less than 25): F.X. McRory's, Collins Pub, Tap House
* [Market Theater](http://www.unexpectedproductions.org/) at Pike Place Market

### Larger

* [Seattle Asian Art Museum](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/) (SAAM). A gorgeous venue and and the novelty of the venue is a draw. Killer place for a post-event party. Some parking.
* [Seattle Center](http://www.seattlecenter.com/) "Northwest Rooms."  This is the land that the Space Needle is on. I've seen events over 250.
* Large theaters: Egyptian Theater (has movie screen), Moore Theater, Paramount Theater, King Cat Theater (mostly concert venues)
* [Town Hall](http://www.townhallseattle.org/) Seattle
* [Union Station](http://www.jewelhospitality.com/) "The Great Hall." The now-renovated giant Seattle train station in Pioneer Square.
* [Community Center at Mercer View](http://www.mercergov.org/Page.asp?NavID=1951) on Mercer Island. Seats hundreds, and surprisingly decent bus service. No atmosphere and nothing nearby.
* Other museums: [Henry Art Gallery](http://www.henryart.org/), [Museum of History and Industry](http://www.seattlehistory.org/) (MOHAI), [Burke Musuem](http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum)
