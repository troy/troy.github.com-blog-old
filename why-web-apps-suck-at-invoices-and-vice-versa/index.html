<div class="entry-content"><p><span style="color: #222222;">On the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://scoutapp.com/">Scout</a><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;support&nbsp;</span><a href="https://groups.google.com/group/scoutapp">mailing list</a>, a prospective customer asked to receive an invoice instead of the typical credit card payment. I have some unique experience with that, so I posted the comment below as food for thought (see&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/scoutapp/browse_thread/thread/660f3ade8bcd5928/e3dce7fb91a7d1b2?#e3dce7fb91a7d1b2">thread</a>).</p>
<p>This is &#8220;Why Web apps suck at invoices&#8221; and &#8220;Why invoices suck for Web apps,&#8221; all rolled into one.&nbsp;Next time someone requests an invoice, send them here.</p>
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;"><!--more--></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">Subject: invoice billing (was: Re: Fees for Rails Apps..)</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">I&#8217;m not affiliated with Scout except as a customer, but I run an unrelated subscription Web service that sells to businesses and I&#8217;m occasionally asked the same question.&nbsp;It sounds like a really simple request, so I can understand the frustration at not being able to accommodate it.</div>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">I wanted to add some color about how challenging it is to provide invoices.&nbsp;I&#8217;m speaking only about my experience, not Scout&#8217;s.&nbsp;Here&#8217;s why this is often a much bigger pain than it looks like, and is often actually a disadvantage to both parties:</span></p>
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">
<ul>
<li>Everything is a one-off. Almost everyone who wants an invoice also needs some other customization: the delivery process, the followup, the formatting (&#8220;We&#8217;re in Germany and our government requires you to tell us who we are&#8221;), whatever. Aside from tracking those one-offs, they makes it harder to solve or automate the other issues below. Which leads me to..</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Everything requires a human. If you don&#8217;t pay, a human has to email you, and it will almost never be worth the time to automate that process (especially in light of customer-specific processes above). Even something as simple as a credit becomes a time sink. A human needs to figure out how much is due (best case, transferring the amount from a summary email that a developer had to implement; worst case, calculating it manually); figure out how to get you the money (edit a future invoice, reissue an existing invoice, or cut you a check); deliver that credit, probably to someone in accounting who doesn&#8217;t know anything about what&#8217;s being purchased; process the payment; and come back a few weeks later to verify it was paid.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someone has to go to the PO Box and then to the bank, and it needs to happen often enough that you don&#8217;t look like an idiot for depositing a 2 month old check.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reconciliation is harder. Accounting typically needs an entry for every individual customer payment, rather than one per day per credit card or however other transactions are handled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having an elastic payment method is really awesome, and our service and many others bake that assumption into our UX decisions and business processes. By &#8220;elastic&#8221; I mean that the amount isn&#8217;t set in stone a month before the service is provided. What should happen if you add a new host that you didn&#8217;t plan for? Does the vendor extend credit, or do they issue an invoice with a pro-rated line item and make you wait until it&#8217;s paid?&nbsp;How about 100 new hosts?&nbsp;Before long, the customer is predicting and committing to a certain amount of usage, quite possibly just to make billing simpler, and we&#8217;ve undone 15 years of software-as-a-service progress.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of this distracts from making the product better. Whether a company has 2 people or 100, the resources are finite, and at some level any other work is in place of product improvements.&nbsp;No Web service will ever be great at invoicing, most will never be good at it, and not one will ever enjoy it. That &#8220;morale debt&#8221; accumulates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The overhead will eventually be reflected in prices, and it&#8217;s way higher than the ~3% for credit cards.&nbsp;This thread started as a question about fees. One reason that Scout is such a good value is that their decisions mostly optimize for practical value. Building off its usage-based fees,&nbsp;would you be willing to pay a $25/invoice fee, and/or have a $500/invoice minimum? From my own experience, that&#8217;s the absolute minimum it takes to make this practical, and I&#8217;m probably still way too low.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222;">
<p />
<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">None of this is rocket science, it just takes time, and that&#8217;s why invoices suck for typical business subscription services.&nbsp;I consider it a positive that Scout is savvy enough to focus on what they&#8217;re good at.</div>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Finally, a potential solution: get&nbsp;a company card that&#8217;s only used for recurring purchases like this. You&#8217;re freed from monthly employee expense reports and accounting gains&nbsp;authoritative information&nbsp;about the transaction, since it&#8217;s essentially their card.</span></p>
